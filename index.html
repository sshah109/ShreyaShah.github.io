									<p>
										This dashboard is a reflection of my passion for marathon running, blending personal achievement with data-driven insights. It serves both as a visual journal and a tool for improvement. The first section maps out my runs across the country, offering a geographical perspective on my journey. The pace trends chart provides a clear view of my speed over time, highlighting areas for potential improvement. Heart rate trends offer a glimpse into my cardiovascular performance, essential for understanding my fitness levels. Finally, the cumulative miles run since I began in 2020 showcases my dedication and progress. This dashboard not only tracks my running journey but also fuels my motivation to achieve new milestones.</p>
